# Chicago's dead-zones


This repository includes the data I pulled from [Antenna Search](https://www.antennasearch.com/HTML/search/search.php?address=Chicago%2C+IL%2C+United+States) and downloaded at [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Buildings/Building-Footprints-current-/hz9b-7nh8).

The tools I used for this mapping project are 👉 Mapbox and QGIS 👈. 
- Mapbox is used to display and pin every registered cell tower🗼 in the city of Chicago (T-mobile towers are highlighted for the narrative).
- QGIS is used here to process a large GeoJSON file downloaded from Chicago Data Portal of its current building Footprints 🏙️.


About data folder:

You can find raw data I pulled from the webpages along with a clean version I edited after so here.
